# USBhub

This is my first ever hardware project including PCB design and exterior modeling!The project is inspired by [the tutorial videos](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1At421h7Ui?spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.episodes&vd_source=a416fcb6c88258170a1902d8753f0269&p=25) posted by **Expert电子实验室**.

The USB hub enables **one** Type-C USB input and **four** Type-A USB output following `USB 2.0 Specification`.

The repository provides the PCB design program file and the 3D model of the shell which can protect the PCB inside. You can find PCB design program file in `.epro` for **Easy EDA** and `.zip` for **Altium Designer**. Besides, you can find 3D model in the folder `shell` in `.stp`.

Hope you can have fun by making your personal USB hub!
