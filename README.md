# USBhub

  This is my first ever hardware project including PCB design and exterior modeling!

<br>
  The USB hub enables **one** Type-C USB input and **four** Type-A USB output following `USB 2.0 Specification`.
  The repository provides the PCB design program file and the 3D model of the shell which can protect the PCB inside. You can find PCB design program file in `.epro` for **Easy EDA** and `.zip` for **Altium Designer**. Besides, you can find 3D model in the fliter `shell` in `.stp`.
